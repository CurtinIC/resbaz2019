# FAQs

## How much is registration?

Registration is free, but for those wanting to attend the 3-day training sessions (Tuesday to Thursday), there will be a limited number of places with an $11/day fee, with lunch provided.

## When will registrations open?

Registrations will open around mid-July.

## Will I need a laptop?

If you attend a training workshop, you will generally need a laptop. If you attend a workshop, set up instructions will be emailed to you prior to the day.

## Can I help out?

Of course! Without volunteers, we couldn't do this every year. Send your details to resbazsydney@googlegroups.com to let us know you're interested. If you're attending the festival, we'd strongly encourage you participate by submitting a poster or lightning talk. These are great ways to introduce yourself to the broader community.
