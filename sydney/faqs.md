# FAQs

## Who can attend?
The event is aimed at NSW researchers, however anyone is welcome to attend.

## How much is registration?
Registration is free, but for those wanting to attend the 3-day training sessions, there will be a limited number of places with an $11/day fee and lunch will be provided. ResBaz is run entirely by volunteers. Our generous host (UNSW this year) and partners (both research and industry) cover overheads, making the event affordable for participants.

## When will registrations open?
This year ResBaz Sydney will be held from Tuesday 10th â€” Friday 13th of September. Registrations will open around mid-July.

To receive updates and be notified when registrations will open please email your name and contact details to resbazsydney@googlegroups.com.

## What is the difference between the training and festival part of the program
This year we're trying something a little different. Every year registration fills in a couple of days, and so we wanted to take the chance to broaden the program to allow more people to attend. As always, there will be a limited number of places available in the training workshops, and this year we'll be charging a small fee ($11/day) to cover costs. As well as this, there will be an open festival free for all to attend, running from 12-5pm, Tuesday to Thursday.
