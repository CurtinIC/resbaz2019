## Will I need a laptop?

If you attend a training workshop, you will generally need a laptop. If you attend a workshop, set up instructions will be emailed to you prior to the day.

## Can I help out?

Of course! Without volunteers, we couldn't do this every year. Send your details to [resbazsydney@googlegroups.com](mailto:resbazsydney@googlegroups.com) to let us know you're interested. If you're attending the festival, we'd strongly encourage you participate by submitting a poster or lightning talk. These are great ways to introduce yourself to the broader community.
