# About

The Research Bazaar (ResBaz) is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the centre of modern research. Throughout 2019 events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.


Perth's ResBaz is a low-cost, 3-day intensive festival and (un-)conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. 

ResBaz Perth 2019 will be held at Curtin University from July 2-4. To understand a little more about ResBaz, watch the video 'What is ResBaz?' below! 

We are still working on the detailed programme, however, you will find our broad sessions outlined below.

## Who should attend?

Researchers at all levels from all disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to apply. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along!

ResBaz is particularly aimed at those new to digital research tools. To hear some testimonals from ResBaz Perth 2017 participants, watch the 'ResBaz testimonials' video below!
