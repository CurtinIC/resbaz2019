# About

Perth's Research Bazaar is a low-cost, 3-day intensive festival and conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. 

Throughout 2019 ResBaz events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe. ResBaz Perth 2019 will be held at Curtin University from July 2-4. To understand a little more about ResBaz, watch this video!
