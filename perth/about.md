# About

The Research Bazaar (ResBaz) is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the centre of modern research. Throughout 2019 events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

Perth's ResBaz is a low-cost, 3-day intensive festival and (un-)conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. 

ResBaz Perth 2019 will be held at Curtin University from July 2-4. To understand a little more about ResBaz, watch the video 'What is ResBaz?' below!
