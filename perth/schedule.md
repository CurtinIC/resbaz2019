# Schedule

We are planning to run several parallel streams this year to cater to new as well as more seasoned learners. 
Training 1 will include the following options:
* Intro to the command line and Version Control (Git)
* Intro to structured data
* Intro to Docker

Training 2 will be run on days 2 and 3 and includes (the level in the brackets refers to your familiarity with programming and not your knowledge of the topic):

* Data analysis and visualisation with Python (beginner level)
* Data analysis and visualisation with R (beginner level)
* Data and digital tools in the Humanities and Arts (beginner level)
* Genomics (specialisation, intermediate level)
* Intro to Machine Learning (intermediate to advanced level)


You will be asked to choose your preferred option for Training 1 and 2 during registration, as the running of each stream will depend on interest.

Don't forget apart from the stream workshops we will also have plenty of elective classes which you choose on the day at the bazaar. The electives will cover some of the "softer" skills on how to promote your research, how to put together a good presentation, and in general how to develop and refine a research questions as well as some more advanced technical subjects like cloud computing or LaTeX.

Plus we have scheduled in some time for community sessions during which we will bring all participants together to work on a common project or to hear from keynote speakers and panels.

We are also planning to finish each day with a social session, e.g. a board game evening, for those interested.
