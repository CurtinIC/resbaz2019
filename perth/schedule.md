# Schedule

We are planning to run several parallel streams this year to cater to new as well as more seasoned learners. 
Training 1 will include the following options:
* Intro to the command line and Version Control (Git)
* Intro to structured data
* Intro to Docker

Training 2 will be run on days 2 and 3 and includes:

* Intro to R (beginner level)
* Intro to Python (beginner level)
* Machine Learning (intermediate to advanced)
* Genomics (specialisation)
* Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS specialisation)

You will be asked to choose your preferred option for Training 1 and 2 during registration, as the running of each stream will depend on interest.
