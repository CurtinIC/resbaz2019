# Who can attend?

The event is aimed at researchers at all levels from all disciplines based in south east Queensland. ResBaz is particularly aimed at those new to digital research tools.

If you are a Master's or PhD student, or an early career researcher, then ResBaz Brisbane is for you! ResBaz Brisbane will help you find others across a range of universities who are exploring the same research problems or trying to learn the same tools and skills. 

ResBaz Brisbane will definitely be one of the most worthwhile networking and skill-building opportunities you can attend in Brisbane this year - and it's fantastic value.  

# What will I learn?

We will offer introductory workshops such as Software Carpentry with R and Software Carpentry with Python, as well as workshops on data clean up and data visualisation, and tips on boosting your research profile. See the program below. You can opt in to various workshops when you register. You can learn how to program in R or Python, see how to automate workflows, how to keep track of different versions of things and then tell stories with your data.

# What is the format?

The first two days (8-10 July) are action-packed with many workshops to choose from. Lunch will be provided as part of your registration fee. On the third day (11 July), you can attend a range of fantastic talks, play games, browse stalls, book time with an expert, view each other's posters, network with others in the knowledge bazaar, win prizes or just chill out with people you've met.

# How much is registration?

Registration is only $40! This very low fee will cover the costs of **all** workshops and events, and will also provide you with lunch and other refreshments over the three days of the event. 

ResBaz is run by volunteers, but our generous host (QUT) and our many sponsors cover most of the overheads, making the event affordable for participants. 

Don't miss out!
