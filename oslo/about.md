# About

The University of Oslo is proud to be hosting ResBaz for the third time in 2019!

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival for researchers, by researchers, aimed to help make research faster, smarter and better. The focus is on digital skills and tools important for modern-day research.

The theme chosen for Research Bazaar Oslo 2019 is:

**Get smart with research data**

We will offer many workshops that will be hands-on, interactive, with lots of practice, rather than one-way lecturing.


## Target audience

PhD candidates, young researchers and students but the event will be open for anyone interested.

Please find the Oslo schedule on our [local website](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/events/all-libraries/2019/research-bazaar-2019.html).
